This involves discussions, interviews, and documentation to ensure a clear understanding of what the software needs to achieve.

3. **<span style="color:purple">Design</span>**: The design phase translates the requirements into a blueprint for the software. The aim is to create a detailed design that guides the development process.

4. **<span style="color:purple">Implementation (Coding)</span>**: During this phase, the actual code is written based on the design specifications.

5. **<span style="color:purple">Testing</span>**: The testing phase involves verifying that the software meets the specified requirements and is free of defects. The goal is to identify and fix any issues before deployment.

6. **<span style="color:purple">Deployment</span>**: In this phase, the software is released to the production environment. This involves installing the software, configuring the system, and training users.

7. **<span style="color:purple">Maintenance</span>**: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase. This deals with monitoring the software for issues, providing updates, and making improvements.

### Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach to software development, whereby each phase must be completed before moving to the next. While Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach to software development emphasizing on flexibility, collaboration, customer feedback and allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation throughout the development process.

**Examples**:
- *<span style="color:red">Waterfall Example</span>*: Developing a software system for a government agency with strict regulatory requirements and well-defined specifications.
- *<span style="color:red">Agile Example</span>*: Creating a mobile application for a startup where requirements may change based on user feedback and market trends.

### Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

In a software engineering team, each role carries specific responsibilities that contribute to the overall success of a project. Below are the roles and responsibilities of different ones in a software engineering team:
